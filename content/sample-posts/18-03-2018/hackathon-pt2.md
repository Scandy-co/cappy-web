Wow. Not much sleep. I think you forget how to sleep as you get older. I'm excited about today. Wearing my NASA shirt because I'm expecting to launch today!

9:30am: grabbed an espresso and donuts from District Donuts. Side note: I LOVE that place.
9:45am: arrived at Scandy to find that Evan had beaten me here. We discuss donuts, sleep (or lack thereof) and code. Cole arrives. Donut consumption and status updates ensue.
