Wow. Not much sleep. I think you forget how to sleep as you get older. I'm excited about today. Wearing my NASA shirt because I'm expecting to launch today!

9:30am: grabbed an espresso and donuts from District Donuts. Side note: I LOVE that place.
9:45am: arrived at Scandy to find that Evan had beaten me here. We discuss donuts, sleep (or lack thereof) and code. Cole arrives. Donut consumption and status updates ensue.

10ish am: George and Trey are on site and cranking. Have given Trey the task of learning Sumerian and seeing how to integrate Cappy. His response: "Seriously?" Yup. Hop on it, dude.  He dives in to press release writing. 

11:00am: Work progressing. Short breaks to give George grief about his 1mm character bytestring entries in the database. Trey and I have no business participating in this, but we do anyway.

12:00pm: donuts and cold pizza for lunch. And Hola Nola chips for the win!

1:00pm: Trey making progress with Sumerian. I'm taking pictures of the Red Screen of Death from ReactNative. Everybody gets into the action. This is typically a sign of progress - or so the team is telling me.

2(ish) pm: Trey has dropped a Cappy of his face (after a few file type changes) into AWS Sumerian. (This is Amazon's Virtual Reality / 3D environment). Trey is our COO. Trey is not a programmer. Trey has gotten it to work. I'm impressed with Sumerian AND Trey. He's taken the Game of Thrones Hall of Faces and put a Cappy of his face on it. He thinks of himself as Jon Snow. I tell him he knows nothing.

3:00pm: Team still cranking. Cole making progress. Evan making progress. George making progress, powering through a persistent cough and running on fumes. He's in beast mode.

4:30pm: The group is winding down. Cole is the first to cry uncle, claiming he needs to get home to the wife. George finishes up the Game of Thrones video for Instagram and we plan our release for Wednesday. We've still got some cleanup to to.

5:15pm: I head out for my mom's birthday party, leaving George and Evan to finsish up. 

The team made awesome progress, and I'm pumped to push our new features out to the App Store. We will keep you posted.
