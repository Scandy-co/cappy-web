Happy St. Patrick's Day!
9:00am: Arrive at off-site location. I've brought snacks, drinks, LOTS of Cool Brew coffee, and a few beers. Everyone is bringing their extra monitors in addition to their laptops in order to maximize productivity. We've got an awesome space for it. My good friend allowed us to use his company's conference room. We've got 2 big whiteboards, a massive TV for demos, and tables on rollers to configure the space however we want.

9:05am: Cole arrives. We start setting up. We quickly realize that we are going to need extension cords to make the space + laptops + extra monitors all work together. Evan arrives. 

9:20am: I'm resourceful. Call wife. Ask her to wake teenage daughter and bribe her to drive over extention cords. 

9:52am: Daughter arrives with extension cords. She departs with my Jeep (part of the bribe).

10:00am: We are all set up and ready to crank. George hasn't arrived yet but we've hit another snag. The wifi is super-fast. But there are no ports open on the router for what we are trying to do. We can't connect laptops to iPhones. Stuck. Problem-solving ensues. I call my buddy about asking his IT guy to open the port we need. The just finished a security audit - not going to happen. More attemps at workarounds. At 10:45am I call it. We back to the office where we can make progress on the app - not the router issues.  

11:10am: Settled in and cranking. 

11:15am: Encounter database issue.

11:30am: I bring everyone a Guiness Stout. It IS St. Patrick's Day. Don't judge.

3:30pm: Break for lunch. At District Donuts, Cole, George and Evan figure out the solution to the database issues.

4:05pm: Cole fixes the database problem we were having.

4:20pm: I go out to get cough drops for George (we will all benefit though). While I was gone, I missed Evan's jubilant cry of "I'm a f*king hacker, bitches!" Apparently, we are making progress. 

5:45pm: I hit a bug in Gatsby and George is still trying to fix it at 6:30pm

7:25pm: I've fixed my issues (along with George's help) by deleting every line that throws an error until there are no more errors. Site is back working with lesser functionality. Damn. Database progress proceeding, but slowly. George is cranking. Evan has been quiet, so I assume there is progress. No shouts of exultation, but no cursing either. 

8:36pm: shouts of "what the hell?" and "I had that same error! It didn't make sense." Also Evan: "Xcode is being an asshole"
